## Create a colour sequence for two Sparkles

Now that you have one Sparkle with a colour sequence, adding a sequence for the second Sparkle is easy.

First, make both Sparkles change colour at the same time.

--- task ---

Carry on with the code for 'sparkle 0'.

Duplicate one of the `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks.

In the duplicated block, change the `0` to a `1`.

Now you have a `set sparkle 1 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} block. Duplicate this block two times.

Put one `set sparkle 1 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks below each `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} block.

If you like:
+ Change the colours in the `set sparkle 1 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks.
+ Adjust the `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} times.

Run the code by clicking on the green triangle **play** button, and watch what happens.

There is no reason why the two Sparkles need to change colour at the same time.

--- task ---

The easiest way to make the Sparkles change colour at different times is to add a `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} block in between the `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks and the `set sparkle 1 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks.

Adjust the wait times for a sequence speed that you like.

Now get creative and make a sequence where the two Sparkles change in any order, timing, and colours you feel like.

You don't even have to alternate the Sparkles. You could make `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} stay the same while `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"} flashes all the colours of the rainbow.

What do you want your Sparkles to do?

If you want to create a complicated sequence, plan it out on of paper first.

--- task ---

Add `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} blocks and `set sparkle to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks to create whatever sequence you feel like.

Think about what your sequence will look like. Then run your program to see whether it creates the sequence you want.
