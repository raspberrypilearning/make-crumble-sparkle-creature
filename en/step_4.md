## Coding two Sparkles

Let's start with a really simple two Sparkle code.

--- task ---

Open the Crumble software on your computer and click the play button just to check that the computer and Crumble are talking to each other.

You should get the message "programming successful".

From the `Basic`{:class="crumblebasic"} palette, grab the `program start`{:class="crumblebasic"} block that starts every bit of Crumble code.

Now switch to the `Sparkles`{:class="crumblesparkles"} palette and take a `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} with a colour picker box, and connect it under the `program start`{:class="crumblebasic"} block.

Right-click on the `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} block and click 'Duplicate'.

Connect the duplicated block and connect it underneath. Click on the '0' in the second `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} block and change it to 1.

Note: The numbering system starts at 0, so the first Sparkle is 'Sparkle 0' and the second is 'Sparkle 1'.

Click on the colour picker boxes to choose a new colour for each of the Sparkles.

Note: The colour picker box will appear different depending on what operating sysyem you are using.

Once you are done, click the play button to run the code and see your Sparkles light up.
