## Challenge: 'follow me' light sequence

Can you make your Sparkle creature's eyes flash in a sequence where one eye (Sparkle 1) turns the colour of the other eye (Sparkle 0), but the moment Sparkle 1 changes to that colour, Sparkle 0 changes to a new colour?

Try to code this 'follow me' sequence so that the second eye follows the first through the colours red, blue, green, and pink 10 times.

Create your program so that:
1. When the `program starts`{:class="crumblebasic"}
1. `repeat ten times`{:class="crumblecontrol"}
1. `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} turns `red`{:class="block3myblocks"}
1. `wait half a second`{:class="crumblecontrol"}
1. `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"} follows by also turning `red`{:class="block3myblocks"}
1. `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} turns `blue`{:class="block3mymotion"}
1. `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} again
1. `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"} follows by also turning `blue`{:class="block3motion"}
1. `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} turns `green`{:class="block3operators"}
1. `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} again
1. `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"} afollows by also turning `green`{:class="block3operators"}
1. `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} turns `pink`{:class="block3sound"}
1. `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} one last time
1. `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"} follows by also turning `pink`{:class="block3sound"}
