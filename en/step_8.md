## Challenge: Traffic light eyes

Can you code your Sparklecreature's eyes to flash like traffic lights?

Many children think that traffic lights turn from red to amber to green and then back to amber and then red but that's not quite right. Traffic lights actually start on green, then turn amber, then go to red but then they turn red and amber at the same time! Finally, they turn green again.
