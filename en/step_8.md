## Challenge: Follow me light sequence

Can you code your Sparkle creature's eyes to flash in a sequence where one eye (Sparkle 1) turns the colour of the other eye (Sparkle 0) but the moment it does the leading eye (Sparkle 0) changes to a new colour?

Can you code this 'follow me' sequence so that the second eye chases the first through the colours red, blue, green and pink and repeat 10 times?

Try and write code so that when the `program starts`{:class="crumblebasic"}, `repeat ten times`{:class="crumblecontrol"} `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} turns `red`{:class="block3myblocks"}, then `wait half a second`{:class="crumblecontrol"} before `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"} turns `red`{:class="block3myblocks"} and `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} turns `blue`{:class="block3mymotion"}. `Wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} again before `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"} also turns `blue`{:class="block3motion"} and `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} turns `green`{:class="block3operators"}. Again, `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} before `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"} becomes `green`{:class="block3operators"} and `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} turns `pink`{:class="block3sound"}. Finally, `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} one last time and turn `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"} `pink`{:class="block3sound"}

You will need to use the blocks below to create the follow me colour sequence code.

Can you rearrange them to make the code work?
