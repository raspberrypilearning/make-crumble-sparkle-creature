## Colour sequence 3 - random Sparkles

First, you are going to make your creature's eyes change at random intervals and then we will look at getting the eyes to also change to random colours!

--- task ---

Let's begin with the `program start`{:class="crumblebasic"} block and add a `do 10 times`{:class="crumblecontrol"} loop block from the `control`{:class="crumblecontrol"} block palette.

Inside the `do 10 times`{:class="crumblecontrol"} loop, add two `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"}`0`{:class="block3myblocks"}`0`{:class="block3operators"}`0`{:class="block3motion"} RGB value blocks. Change the second from `Sparkle 0`{:class="crumblesparkles"} to `Sparkle 1`{:class="crumblesparkles"}.

Set the `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"}`0`{:class="block3myblocks"}`0`{:class="block3operators"}`0`{:class="block3motion"} RGB value blocks to values of your choice and add a `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} block under them.

Now you need another set of `set sparkle`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks and another wait block. You could pick them out from the block palettes as normal but the quickest way is to duplicate the ones that you already have.

When you duplicate blocks in Crumble, you always copy the block you are on and all the blocks below it.

--- task ---

Right-click on the first `set sparkle`{:class="crumblesparkles"} block and click 'duplicate'.

Drag the duplicated blocks inside the `repeat`{:class="crumblecontrol"} loop underneath your existing `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} block.

Carrying right on from the code that we had before, in Colour sequence 1, add more `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks either from the `Sparkle`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks palette or by duplicating the ones that you already have. 

Hint: We will have to change them to `set sparkle 1 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} so it is easiest to change one and then duplicate that.

Put one of the new `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks under each existing `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} block and chnage the `0`{:class="crumblesparkles"}s to `1`{:class="crumblesparkles"}s to make them `set sparkle 1 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks.

Leave or adjust the wait times for a sequence speed that you like. You don't have to have all the wait times the same as each other.
