## Colour sequence 3 - random Sparkles

First, you are going to make your creature's eyes change at random intervals and then we will look at getting the eyes to also change to random colours!

Carrying right on from the code that we had before, in Colour sequence 1, add more `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks either from the `Sparkle`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks palette or by duplicating the ones that you already have. 

Hint: We will have to change them to `set sparkle 1 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} so it is easiest to change one and then duplicate that.

Put one of the new `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks under each existing `set sparkle 0 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} block and chnage the `0`{:class="crumblesparkles"}s to `1`{:class="crumblesparkles"}s to make them `set sparkle 1 to`{:class="crumblesparkles"} blocks.

Leave or adjust the wait times for a sequence speed that you like. You don't have to have all the wait times the same as each other.
